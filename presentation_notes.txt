ANSI Colors
There are 16 ANSI Colors, which are actually 8 colors, each having "normal" and "bright" intensity variants. The colors are black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, and white. In certain circumstances bright intensity could be actually brighter, or, in the case of an xterm, it could be bold.


Usage Syntax
To set a font to the color and style desired, we use the syntax \033[#m where # can be a valid set of semicolon separated numbers. The \033[ is a control sequence initiator which begins an escape sequence. In our case the sequence is a set of "m" terminated select graphic rendition parameters for rendering the text as desired.

- How does color happen in your terminal? 
    - https://gist.github.com/jasonm23/2868981
    - echo one color
    - echo with escape character we can demonstrate this 
    - Print all the colors

    - Configure stuff with tput to get color 
    - Drop down to echo

        - It’s even clever enough to inspect your terminal metrics meaning that if the terminal is larger you will see more pixels in the terminal:
        - And if you need heaps more detail just make your terminal font smaller…

- Really cool feature
- Step through PERL Code 
    - SHIT; SIIT; Emoji poo 💩
    - Clever Shit
    - By using 0x2584 - the Unicode character “Lower half block - with different foreground and background colours the terminal resolution can be doubled. I love that it does this!
    - HERES ALL THIS PERL CODE 
        - Highlight a few areas.

- Issues Native 
- OMG PRINT ALL THE WAY down
    - ls * lah 
- How does it do it? 
    - 
- Crazy ideas
    - for ls add colors for size 
    - add syntax highlighting for bash 
    - print out images or maybe even gifs. 

Terminal Windows 
    - Print echo all colors
